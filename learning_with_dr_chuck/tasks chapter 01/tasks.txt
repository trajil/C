Exercise 1-19. Write a program detab which replaces tabs in the input with the proper number of blanks to space to the next tab stop. Assume a fixed set of tab stops, say every n positions.

Exercise 1-20. Write the program entab which replaces strings of blanks by the minimum number of tabs and blanks to achieve the same spacing. Use the same tab stops as for detab.

Exercise 1-21. Write a program to "fold" long input lines after the last non-blank character that occurs before the n-th column of input, where n is a parameter. Make sure your program does something intelligent with very long lines, and if there are no blanks or tabs before the specified column.

Exercise 1-22. Write a program to remove all comments from a C program. Don't forget to handle quoted strings and character constants properly.

Exercise 1-23. Write a program to check a C program for rudimentary syntax errors like unbalanced parentheses, brackets and braces. Don't forget about quotes, both single and double, and comments. (This program is hard if you do it in full generality.)
